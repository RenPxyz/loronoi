loronoi
=======

3d visualization of Voronoi diagrams within python.

The program is not fully functional at the moment.  I am
not sure exactly what the python-scipy spatial.Voronoi package
does in 3d, but this code is attempting to look into it.

Requires:
---------

    python 
    python-numpy 
    python-scipy - a more recent version which includes spatial.Voronoi 
    python-visual 


How to use:
-----------

The Loronoi class is held in the Loronoi.py file.
Check it out.


An example of how to use the class is in test.py.  Run:

    python test.py
